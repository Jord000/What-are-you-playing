# What are you playing?

This app was created as an exploration of React-Native, Typescript and Native-Wind(TailwindCSS for React-Native). Built for Android, the app shows a list of Nintendo games which the user can add to their list of current playing games. Once finished playing they can remove the game from their list using the minus icon. The username can be changed to a custom name, an error will show if 0 chars is entered. Scroll functions are included as well as the ability to drop the key input by clicking outside.

To use the app you will require expo and either expo-go or android studio. Download the repo and run npm i, then run npm start to load the app locally.
